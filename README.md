**End to End Data Engineering Project**

The objective of this project is to **design and implement a scalable, cloud-based data engineering pipeline** for an e-commerce platform using **Azure services**. The pipeline will enable **efficient data ingestion, transformation, enrichment** by integrating multiple data sources **(HTTP, SQL, MongoDB)**, ensuring data quality, and providing actionable insights through advanced analytics and visualization tools.

**Architecture:**

**âœ… Key Goals:**
â€¢	Automate Data Ingestion: Seamlessly ingest data from diverse sources (HTTP, SQL, MongoDB) into ADLS Gen2 storage using Azure Data Factory.
â€¢	Implement Medallion Architecture: Organize and transform data through bronze, silver, and gold layers to improve data quality and accessibility.
â€¢	Enable Data Transformation & Enrichment: Leverage Azure Databricks for data processing and MongoDB for data enrichment.
â€¢	Optimize Analytics with Synapse: Use Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying, analytics, and reporting on large datasets.
â€¢	Create Interactive Visualizations: Build dynamic dashboards with Power BI/Tableau/Fabric to provide meaningful business insights.
â€¢	Ensure Production-Readiness: Apply best practices for performance optimization, error handling, monitoring, and maintenance.
